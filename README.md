# AboutMe

    * Who are you? What is your background?
    I'm Robel Arega. I'm a power distribution Engineer.

    * What are your career goals?
    Eventually I want to join a Quant Trading team in Chicago.

    * Why did you choose FinTech as a career path?
    FinTech is a booming field with a lot of opportunities. The energy field, even though it seems like it's innovating, hasn't updated SOPs for designing Substations in decades. FinTech excites me, and it seems like a career I will enjoy and make an actual impact.
